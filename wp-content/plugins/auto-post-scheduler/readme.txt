This plugin will schedule 'auto post checks' to publish new posts and/or recycle old posts automatically.


== Description ==

Use the Auto Post Scheduler to publish new posts and/or recycle old posts, automatically! No need to schedule post times individually, and recycling old posts keeps your site looking fresh. 

Especially useful when importing a large number of posts, you can 
have the Auto Post Scheduler publish them at whatever frequency you choose.

Works great with the auto blogging plugin <http://videoblogsterpro.com>


== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through WordPress admin or upload the `Auto Post
Scheduler` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit `Settings -> Auto Post Scheduler` to set options and Enable the scheduler.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't the auto post checks trigger? Nothing is happening. =

1. Auto Post Scheduler hooks into the WordPress WP-Cron for scheduling. These
cron events are typically only checked when a visitor loads any WordPress page on the 
site. If there are no visitors, there can be no cron checks and therefore no
auto post checks.

2. If you are using .htaccess to allow,deny by IP, make sure to allow the IP
of your WordPress site itself as the wp-cron uses that IP address.

= Error: aps_auto_hook not scheduled, likely another plugin misuse of cron_schedules =

This happens when another plugin incorrectly replaces cron_schedules with
their own schedules instead of correctly adding to existing schedules, so the
other plugin actually removes our aps_auto_hook. Other plugin code needs to be fixed.

= How do I turn off WP_Cron and use server cron jobs instead? =

WordPress calls WP_Cron on every page load to check for cron_schedules.
If you have a high traffic site, you might want to use caching or set cron checks on a
schedule instead to save on resources. See
[this post](http://www.superblogme.com/wordpress-calling-wp-cron-vs-cron-job-calling-wp-cron/)
for more information.

To do this:

1. Make sure Auto Post Scheduler is enabled.
2. Edit /wp-config.php and add the line
`define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);`
3. From the server command line, edit your cron with 'crontab -e' and add the line
`*/5 * * * * wget -q -O -"http://www.mydomain.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron='date +\%s'" > /dev/null2>&1`

and change 'mydomain' to your site domain.

This crontab entry will call wp_cron every 5 minutes.

= When using WP Super Cache the Home/Front page isn't updated when APS publishes a post or recycles an old post. Why is that? =

As far as I know, WP Super Cache must not hook into when a post status has
changed. User MassimoD reports "Quick Cache does, W3Total Cache does, Hyper
Cache does, Gator Cache does. Only WP Super Cache doesn't."


= Does this plugin have any callable filters? =

Yes! In case you think of something that is not covered in the plugin settings, here are the available filter hooks:

* <strong>aps_eligible_query</strong> - passed value is the array that will be used by WP_Query to find eligible posts. Any changes will also apply to aps_recycle_query as well.
* <strong>aps_recycle_query</strong> - passed value is the array that will be used by WP_Query to find recyclable posts if there are no eligible posts found.
* <strong>aps_update_post</strong> - passed value is the array that will be used by wp_update_post when publishing a draft or pending post.
* <strong>aps_recycle_post</strong> - passed value is the array that will be used by wp_update_post when recycling a published post.

Example Usage #1: I only want to publish or recycle posts that have the tag 'featured'.

Add this code snippet to your theme's functions.php file or equivalent.

`function my_aps_eligible_change($args) {
        $args['tag'] = 'featured';
        return $args;
}
add_filter( 'aps_eligible_query', 'my_aps_eligible_change' );`


Example Usage #2: I want to add a post meta field when a post has been recycled.

Add this code snippet to your theme's functions.php file or equivalent.

`function my_aps_recycle_post($args) {
        $postID = $args['ID'];
        add_post_meta( $postID, 'aps_recycled', 1, true ) || update_post_meta( $postID, 'aps_recycled', 1 );
        return $args;
}
add_filter( 'aps_recycle_post', 'my_aps_recycle_post' );`


= I'm a little confused between Eligible Posts and Recycle Mode. Can you elaborate how it works? =

Hopefully this table will help. Hopefully.

`
Eligible Posts?    Pick Random?    Recycle Posts?  RESULTS over multiple auto post checks

drafts             no              no              drafts ordered by date and published. 
                                                   if no drafts nothing happens.

drafts             yes             no              drafts picked randomly and published. 
                                                   if no drafts nothing happens.

drafts, publish    no              no              drafts and published posts are ordered by date and either published or recycled.

drafts, publish    yes             no              drafts and published posts are ordered randomly and either published or recycled.

drafts, publish    no              yes             drafts and published posts are ordered by date and either published or recycled. 
                                                   Recycle Posts does not apply since there are always eligible posts.
