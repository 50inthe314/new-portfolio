HubSpot All-In-One Marketing, is a free all-in-one marketing plugin that allows you to easily use HubSpot forms, popups, and live chat on your WordPress site and create and send email campaigns. If you’re already a HubSpot user, the plugin lets you connect your HubSpot account to your website without any code.

== Description ==

*HubSpot All-In-One Marketing is the ultimate free plugin for WordPress if you want to grow your email list, manage your contacts, and send marketing emails all through HubSpot’s free CRM.*

The free plugin includes lead capture tools like forms, popups, live chat, and an integrated free contact database (CRM). Once you grow your email list you can also send email campaigns and manage your digital ads through HubSpot. All these features work immediately with no developer help needed.

HubSpot All-In-One Marketing automatically captures form submissions from your site and adds them to the fully integrated WordPress CRM, even if they come from a different tool.

By adding this plugin to your WordPress site, you’ll gain access to HubSpot’s free CRM, marketing, sales, and customer service tools, as well as HubSpot Academy, our free online educational resource.

Here’s how HubSpot All-In-One Marketing will help you capture more leads and grow your email list.

*Forms & Popups: To grow your email list*

Build and add forms and popups to your website in minutes using the drag and drop form builder. You can choose from four types of WordPress forms:

- Inline form: A form you can embed directly on your site pages
- Overlay modals: Center screen popups that appear on top of page content
- Top banners: Small banners at the top of the page
- Slide-in boxes: Small boxes that slide in from the side or bottom of the page

If you’re already using a WordPress form tool on your site, HubSpot will automatically capture form submissions and add them to your contact database so you can manage them in one place. The plugin supports the popular form plugins like Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms, WPForms, Contact Form 7, and more.

*Live Chat & Chatbots: Let your site visitors talk to you*

HubSpot allows you to embed a <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/live-chat?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces" target="_blank">free live chat</a> module to your website and let site visitors chat with you. Using the plugin, you can set up the following WordPress live chat modules:

- Support live chat: Answer questions your customers might have about your business through live chat
- Sales live chat: Help answer questions your potential customers might have through live chat
- Automated chatbot: Set up an automated chatbot to respond to your website visitors when you aren’t online to respond to live chat messages

*Email Marketing*

Send marketing emails to your contacts. Select an email design from our template library and use our drag and drop email editor to craft and send the perfect email. Then analyze your email performance to see how each contact interacted with your email.

*Simple Email Automation*

Send an automated email when someone fills out a form, submits a popup form, or sends a message on live chat. Automated emails are helpful for engaging with your subscribers and customers at the time that matters most: when they’re engaging with you. All emails you send including open and click rates, will be automatically logged in the integrated WordPress CRM so you can see exactly who opens and clicks your emails.

*Fully Integrated Customer Relationship Management*

HubSpot All-In-One Marketing comes with a <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces" target="_blank">free HubSpot CRM</a>. When someone fills out your form, their data is sent directly to your HubSpot CRM so you can easily organize and segment your contacts into lists. HubSpot provides the easiest-to-use WordPress CRM and allows you to store up to 1 million contacts for free.

*Built-in Analytics: To improve your conversions*

Built-in analytics makes it clear which pages and traffic sources drive the most conversions so you can keep doing what’s working.

> “HubSpot educates marketers beyond just the anonymous analytics they get from Google Analytics. Instead, it digs down to individual users.” – Michael Shoup, Founder / CEO, 12South Marketing

= Why aren’t my popups working? =

There are three reasons your popup forms may not be working:

1. Your tracking code is not installed properly. Please see the instructions above, or <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/lead-flows/why-arent-my-lead-flows-displaying?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces" target="_blank">this article for troubleshooting</a>.
2. You previously cancelled, or pressed “x,” on your popup. Once you dismiss the popup we will not show it for 14-days.
3. You, or your contact, already filled out the popup form. Once a popup form is submitted, it will not display again for the same user.

= What will my visitors see if I have multiple popup forms active on a page? =

**If a visitor has previously dismissed a popup form:**
They won’t be presented with that same popup form for 14 days. If they previously submitted that popup and view a page with the same popup on the same browser without clearing their cookies, they will not be shown the same popup form again.

**If more than one popup is set to a single URL:**
The popup form set to the most specific page URL will take priority. For example, if you have a popup set to load on “All Pages” and a popup is set to load on “http://www.domain.com/home”, the popup form set to load on “http://www.domain.com/home” will display. This applies to popups that have the same triggers (On 50% page scroll, On exit intent, etc) or the same type (popup box, dropdown banner, etc).

**If there are two popups with different triggers set to load on the same page with the same location specificity:**
The popup form won’t conflict each other and will wait for their respective triggers, given that the user has not previously submitted or dismissed either popup form. For example, if a popup form is set to load on all pages and is triggered on 50% page scroll and another popup is set to load on all pages and is triggered on exit intent, the two popups will load when the user triggers each popup.
