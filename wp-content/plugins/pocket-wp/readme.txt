Pocket WP allows you to embed your Pocket links into a WordPress page or post via a shortcode or a widget.

== Description ==

Pocket WP connects to the Pocket API and pulls in your latest saved links with tags and excerpts into a WordPress page, post or widget.

= Setup =

Due to the way Pocket's API works, you need to complete a few steps before you can use the plugin.

1. Install and activate the plugin.

2. Create an application on the [Pocket Developers website](http://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new), enter your Consumer Key into the Pocket WP settings page and click Save Changes to start the authorization process.

3. Click the Get Access Key link to complete the authorization.

= Shortcode =

The shortcode embeds a list of Pocket links into a page or post.

The basic shortcode is `[pocket_links]` and it accepts some optional arguments:

`count: [any number] // How many links to display. Default is all.`

`excerpt: yes, no // Whether or not to display the excerpt extracted by Pocket. Default is yes.`

`tag: [any one of your Pocket tags] // Choose to show links from one tag. Supports one tag only. Default is all links, tagged or untagged.`

`credit: yes, no // Choose to add author credit. Default is to not show credit links.`

`tag_list: yes, no // Whether or not to show a list of tags after each link.`

= Widget =

The Widget is available to drag and drop into any widgetized sidebars. It has some options:

`title // the title for the widget`

`count // the number of links to show. Default is 5`

`tag: [any of your Pocket tags] // Choose to show links from one tag. Currently supports one tag only. Default is all links, tagged or untagged.`

`author credit: yes, no // Choose to give author credit. Default is to not show credit links.`
