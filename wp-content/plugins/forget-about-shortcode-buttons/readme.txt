**Feature requests/ideas welcome!**

Forget About Shortcode (FASC) Buttons are a visual way to add CSS buttons in the rich text editor and to your themes.  Instead of adding shortcodes in the post editor, you insert real, styled buttons - making the process of adding buttons to your posts and pages much more natural whilst improving the appearance and usability of the post editor.

FASC Buttons tries to be as clean as possible with the html, only using data attributes for necessary features - the buttons you use in the post editor use the exact same classes as on the front end of your site with no extra or hidden markup to make them behave this way.

* New - add FASC buttons to widgets in WP 4.8 :)

* Editing a button couldn't be easier - just double click a button and an options panel appears allowing you to completely reconfigure the current button - beats tedious shortcodes and using precise syntax!

* Utilises the latest CSS properties for styling

* Includes Dashicons & [Font Awesome Icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) to add to your buttons and use in your themes.

**Your ratings mean a lot - if you like the plugin please consider leaving a review.**

**This plugin is only compatible with WordPress 4.2 and upwards (download version 1.x for compatibility with WP 3.9 - 4.1)**
