<strong>Type:</strong> Digital and On-Site Promotion Design and Development
<strong>Created for:</strong> Plato's Closet (50 in the 314, contracted through Scorch Agency)
<strong>Objective:</strong> Create promotional materials for on-site promotional efforts at Plato's Closet's in the St. Louis area. [/box]
Plato’s Closet, a “re-seller” of brand name clothes and accessories, was one of the first clients I worked with on a professional level. The St. Louis franchisee owner was great at coming up with promotions and contests, finding different ways of getting people through the door. Because of this, we had a pretty stringent promotional and content schedule, and these pieces had to be moved on a monthly basis. Once one concept was built and approved, it was on to the next one. This gave us an opportunity to stretch our creative muscle, but plan ahead to make sure we hit all deadlines.
We unified the brand across multiple mediums. The promotions would be announced on-site through ads and bag-stuffers, and online through their Facebook pages. We invested heavily in Facebook, using the FBML language to create a site within Facebook for each promotion, and created their own mini-applications where users could sign up for email updates or view the locations in their city. A very fluid system, and able to be updated fairly hassle free. We also kept the conversation going with their fans, with daily updates and quick features like highlighting the employees personal styles to humanize the brand.
Using this strategy, we grew the St. Louis Plato’s Closet chain till they had the largest following out of all the stores, with almost 5,800 active users, and even added the Chicago locations to our client-roll.
