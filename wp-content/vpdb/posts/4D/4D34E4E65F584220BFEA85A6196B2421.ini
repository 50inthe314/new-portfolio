<strong>Type:</strong> Logo comps, Simple T-Shirt, Bumper Stickers
<strong>Created for:</strong> Tom Schweich for State Auditor Campaign (50 in the 314)
<strong>Objective:</strong> Create a set of “Fun” logos to use for stickers, t-shirts, and bumper stickers.
[/box]
I was brought on to this project to create a set of “Fun” logos. Something they could put on a t-shirt or a sticker to humanize the campaign and show a different side of Tom Schweich. I took one of the ideas from a campaign staffer, who always complained of people mispronouncing Schweich’s name, and turned his name into a riddle.
I also had the idea to crib off a fellow Republican, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and borrow his famous campaign slogan “I Like Ike”. They ended up running with the “I Like Schweich” slogan and logo, ordering t-shirts and even placing it in one of their campaign commercials
