<p dir=\"ltr\">Some businesses start on a wing and a prayer. I’m the guy who installs the jet packs to get you off the ground faster. I’m proficient to fitting the right technology to fit your venture, but at the same time not overloading you with unnecessary tech to to confuse, or worse, cost you money. I keep it lean, but expandable for the future.</p>
I’m also a great resource to vette contractors and make sure they understand the scope of your project. Some developers want to keep it lean, but make impossible to update your site without their help and their workrate coming into play. Others want to give you every tool possible, but leave it up to you to plug everything together. I’ll make sure everyone is on the same page for a successful build.

When running a small business, time is everything. When you have to manage finances, haggle leases, cut checks to employees, and get a product out to the masses, marketing is usually one of the first things that can fall by the wayside. I’ll show you how to get the most out of the time you set aside to expand marketing efforts and gain business, while making sure everyone is paid on time.

Prices for online marketing software are intimidating if you’re just trying to get a business off the ground. I specialize in getting the most out of the free tools available and can show you how sales can add up when you have a 100% return on investment.

Businesses thrive off of their core audience; the people who always come back for more and bring their friends with them. I will help identify this audience, and come up with creative ways to reward them and to add to their numbers. In the long run, they’ll just bring the business to you!

<p dir=\"ltr\">Ever since college, this nerd-obsessive way of life has turned to marketing and communication arts, with a strong interest in startups and helping to incubate new and exciting ideas.  I have taken detours along the way, spending a semester obsessed with graphic design and branding, another teaching myself how to develop websites and grow a social media fanbase. But it always points back to building a brand and pushing great ideas, great products, and great people to succeed.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve always been excited to meet new people, figure out what their needs are, and discover how to make their message be heard. It’s not really about seeing advertising I’ve worked on up in lights, nor being part of a project whose goal is just to sell and make a buck– it’s knowing that I was a part of something that achieved what others thought was impossible.</p>
It is my belief that nerds make the best kind of workers because we’re not afraid to try. We don’t let a lack of knowledge stand in our way. We open up Google, find out what we need to learn and make ourselves the experts. Designers have the pen, digital guys have code and the project managers keep it all running smoothly. But only a nerd will learn how to do it all. And when the next latest-and-greatest medium comes out, we’ll be standing there saying “Here’s that thing I was telling you about.”"
