<strong>Type:</strong> Presentation (Capstone Project)
<strong>Created for:</strong> RFP for State Farm
<strong>Objective:</strong> Present a full-service advertising campaign targeting young adults (18-25) utilizing television, digital, and on-site promotions for State Farm Insurance [/box]
My team was tasked with creating  full service advertising campaign for State Farm, including release schedule and budget, then condensing all of that information down to a plans book, and presenting it to their representatives in a 20 min block. Because of the complexity, we kept it pretty straightforward. We presented our objectives up front and the research in a way where it wouldn’t overtake the reader.
Concepts were broken up by full page spreads in order to give the reader the tone of the concept before going into the facts and numbers.
The budget was presented in long-form, with paragraphs describing the reasoning behind the buy. We wanted to avoid tucking the budget into the back, hoping they skim over it, and show we were not afraid to defend our reasoning.
(Strategy on budget and new media, layout for financials and schedule, assisted in comps for the new media examples, part of final approval team)
