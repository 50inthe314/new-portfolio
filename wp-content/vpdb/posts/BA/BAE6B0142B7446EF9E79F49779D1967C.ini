<strong>Type:</strong> On-Site Promotional Materials and Presentation Layout
<strong>Created for:</strong> Anheuser-Busch Tour Center (50 in the 314)
<strong>Objective:</strong> Assist the internal marketing team with comps for a photo-jacket, and update internal training documents.  [/box]
No matter what kind of project I become a part of, my skills in graphic design come into play. It could be a full project management / account service gig, but I somehow always end up opening Photoshop at least once.
I worked at the Anheuser-Busch Tour Center all throughout college. It was a great part time job while going to classes, as it had a flexible schedule, great people, and gave me the presentation and leadership skills I still use to this day. During that time what started as a simple Tour and Gift Shop operation grew to include VIP / speciality tours, classes on tasting beer, and other operations to entertain the guest. After my internship with Osbourne and Barr, I came back to my original job as a VIP Tour Guide, but was put on a special project that used some of my graphic design skills.
The Tour Center was expanding services to include photography. Guests would have chances to get a professional photo taken in front of the brewhouse or the bottling plant and at they end of the tour they would be able to purchase the photo in a folder. The team wanted to comp up the photo folder and graphics for the program before presenting to the upper management and the 3rd party photography vendor. I delivered 2 comps, and the one presented here was developed to a fuller extent for the presentation, with two styles of copy for the inside. In the end, the 3rd party used some elements of my design, but they went with a vendor that already had a stock folder design. Still, this was a cool experience because I got to play around with the AB asset library, and show the management how my skills outside of work grew since I started there as a freshman.
The work at the bottom is an internal information packet that they had me update for the them. The design was not by me, but I like to put this piece in here because its a great example of working with what you got. When I said I'd be happy to help, they handed me a .PDF and an ancient Quark Art file. It dawned on me that this document has not been updated since 2000, and the software has long since been depreciated. I ended up exporting out the text and images in Acrobat, ripping out the template for the vector decoration and layout in Illustrator, found a font that was close to what they had originally, and assembled it all in InDesign. I basically ripped apart the file, and put it back together, just to make it workable again.
