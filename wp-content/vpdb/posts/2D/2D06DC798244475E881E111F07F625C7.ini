In my personal opinion, Buzzfeed is the \"Aunt Agnes\" of marketing. Just like that time she asked you if you were into \"Twerking\", the arrival of a listicle making fun of a overused marketing trope is a signal that the fad is over and you need to look into another strategy.
The problem with using stock photos in Higher Ed is that, plainly, its lazy. You don't have to hire models, you have the sets on site, and more then likely you have someone on campus with a DSLR and Photoshop. That could be someone in the marketing department, a faculty member with a hobby, or a student desperately looking for portfolio work. The best thing about working in Higher Ed is the resources available. Use them!"
