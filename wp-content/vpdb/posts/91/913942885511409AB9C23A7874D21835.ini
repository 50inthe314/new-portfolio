<strong>Type:</strong> RFP Response Presentation (The Able Few)
<strong>Created for:</strong> RFP for PBS Nine Network St. Louis
<strong>Objective:</strong> Present a number of concepts for a technological overhaul of the commons area outside of the St. Louis PBS office
[/box]
We had to present several concepts and a rough budget for this RFP, in hopes of getting to a second round where concepts chosen would be developed in more detail. We originally planned a “small, medium, large” phased approach to present, but after discussion two of the ideas could be completed side by side so it became one small concept, and a two-phase large concept. PBS was able to determine the phases needed for the initial buy.
The large project was to turn the commons area into a “Mood Ring for St. Louis”. We’d use data from social media and government API’s to determine the current mood of the city, and reflect that information in the commons. An abstract idea, we needed to figure out a way to show this in a few quick slides. We first created a color mosaic, fading into photos that color was based off of, then show sample data “captions” to reveal why this color was chosen.
(Built the presentation, created the comp images, assisted in strategy and development of all ideas)
