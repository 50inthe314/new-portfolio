\"This is genius implementation of a QR code\"
Seriously, the QR code is the &lt;blink&gt; of marketing. It filled a needed gap before technology / common sense caught up, but now it's the sign of someone who hasn't updated his business cards in a while. It's a gimmick that's not usually done well, but like a billboard with a deliciously clever pun, sometimes the creativity saves the medium."
