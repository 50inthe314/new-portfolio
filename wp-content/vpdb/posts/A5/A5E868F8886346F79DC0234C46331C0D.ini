I’m proficient to fitting the right technology to fit your venture, but at the same time not overloading you with unnecessary tech to to confuse, or worse, cost you money. I keep it lean, but expandable for the future.</p>
I’m also a great resource to vette contractors and make sure they understand the scope of your project. Some developers want to keep it lean, but make impossible to update your site without their help and their workrate coming into play. Others want to give you every tool possible, but leave it up to you to plug everything together. I’ll make sure everyone is on the same page for a successful build.
