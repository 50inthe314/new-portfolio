Order is something that is hard to keep when running a small business or a startup. There are constantly different hands on different projects, and it can get really confusing to know who’s in charge of what. Not to mention organization, keeping files in check, and not having to redo work because something got deleted. I have managed builds and projects spread across many contractors, and with thousands of assets in play, where communication and organization is required. I know the tools to keep a project running smoothly and with little loss.

Modern websites have become more streamlined because attention and screen-sizes have shrunk while making a purchase has become a two-tap affair. I can show you how your site content needs to reflect both what you want to accomplish out of your digital presence, and the needs of the customers who go there.

Buying media online, whether it’s Google ads, Facebook promoted posts, or even old-school banner placement, is loaded with enough metrics to make your head spin! I can help you cut through the superfluous fluff, and focus on the key metrics that your company needs to pay attention to.

You can be a social media darling with a ton of followers and people freaking out about your product. If your website makes it difficult to order your product, or to find where they can purchase, you’re losing sales. I can do a full digital brand analysis, figure out the holes your customers are falling through, and how to plug them.

<p dir=\"ltr\">Ever since college, this nerd-obsessive way of life has turned to marketing and communication arts, with a strong interest in startups and helping to incubate new and exciting ideas.  I have taken detours along the way, spending a semester obsessed with graphic design and branding, another teaching myself how to develop websites and grow a social media fanbase. But it always points back to building a brand and pushing great ideas, great products, and great people to succeed.</p>
<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve always been excited to meet new people, figure out what their needs are, and discover how to make their message be heard. It’s not really about seeing advertising I’ve worked on up in lights, nor being part of a project whose goal is just to sell and make a buck– it’s knowing that I was a part of something that achieved what others thought was impossible.</p>
It is my belief that nerds make the best kind of workers because we’re not afraid to try. We don’t let a lack of knowledge stand in our way. We open up Google, find out what we need to learn and make ourselves the experts. Designers have the pen, digital guys have code and the project managers keep it all running smoothly. But only a nerd will learn how to do it all. And when the next latest-and-greatest medium comes out, we’ll be standing there saying “Here’s that thing I was telling you about.”"
