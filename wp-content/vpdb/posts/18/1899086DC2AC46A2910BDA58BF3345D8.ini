<strong>Type:</strong> Logo Comps, Website Design
<strong>Created for:</strong> Infuz (Contracted through 50 in the 314)
<strong>Objective:</strong> Create branding and a website to allow employees of Infuz to keep track of their “Summer of Random” morale program.[/box]
Infuz, an ad agency in St. Louis, was planning on a summer-long employee morale program, doing things such as having a sand castle contest in the office, a luau on the roof, and palm trees in the office. The owners of Infuz wanted a site where they could drop hints about what’s next and show off previous festivities. I partnered with my good friend and copywriter Nick Bankhead to create a theme for each event, including a social strategy and comped up how we saw the content was going to flow. We also developed a blog design to match their “beach / summer” theme. Eventually, the project was taken over by their internal team, but they based their final product off these comps, and even invited us to the luau!
